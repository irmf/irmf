# 001-sphere

One of the most notoriously-difficult objects to model and create using additive manufacturing 
is the perfectly-smooth sphere (*e.g.* a ball bearing, or actually any smooth, curved surface).
STL (a triangle-based representation) is simply the wrong tool for the job.
Not even voxels solve the problem due to their finite image resolution.

Yet, ironically, the perfect sphere is the very easiest thing to model using an IRMF shader.
