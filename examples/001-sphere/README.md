# 001-sphere

One of the most notoriously-difficult objects to model and create using additive manufacturing 
is the perfectly-smooth ball bearing (or actually any smooth curved surface).
STL (a triangle-based representation) is simply the wrong tool for the job.
Voxels do not even solve the problem due to a finite image resolution.

Yet, ironically, the perfect sphere is the very easiest thing to model using an IRMF shader.
